## Assignments

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

Solve each exercise on a separate branch and merge to master when they are complete.  Be sure to run `$ node review.js` before pushing to make it easier for your coaches to review your work.

* [learn-fetch](https://github.com/oliverjam/learn-fetch) & [real-world-fetch](https://github.com/oliverjam/real-world-fetch)
    * These repository contain a very helpful README, starter code in `workshop.html` and a solution to study.
    * Your task is to write a _different_ solution with separated concerns that runs from _index.html_
    * Turn on github-pages so your coaches can review the live project
* [Fetching Data](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/fetching-data)

#### Integrating JavaScript

* Form a group of 2-3 and Complete 1 [JavaScript 30](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/javascript-30) group challenge, your choice!
  * Link to your team's main repository in your homework issue

#### Suggested Study

* [async/await](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+async+await+javascript&atb=v214-2__&iar=videos&iax=videos&ia=videos)

### Project: `restful-pjs`

> [Starter Code](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission/#projects)



* A `development-strategy.md` file to explain how you built the app in small pieces (this file doesn't need to match the tutorial!)
* One branch per step in your `development-strategy.md`
* The final tutorial code refactored into a well-thought-out folder structure
* A project board & issues to track your progress through your development strategy
* A live demo
* A complete README

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, the organization of your code, and the completeness of your README.
